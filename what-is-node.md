1\. In your own words highlight the differences in functionality and purposes Client-Side and Server-Side code serves in a full-stack web application.<br/> 
>I'm trying to simplify as best as I can.<br>Client Side JavaScript runs on a user's computer. It runs operations and renders pages based on the user's interactions. Client Side JavaScript interfaces with the DOM, as the reading says, and manipulates the pages and HTML it interacts with.<br>Server-side JavaScript does not do these tasks. Server-side operates on the back end, or a server. It uses requests from the HTTP to `GET` or `POST` data. Server-side manages tasks behind the scenes to access, retrieve, manipulate and send data.

2\.   What explains Nodes' rise in popularity and use? What does "Isomorphic JavaScript programming" mean? Provide some real-world examples not listed in this checkpoint of companies using Node.js.<br/>
>The rise in Node JS is because of the use of a single language as opposed to using 2, 3 or more languages to access and use a server for data. Isomorphic JavaScript is just that, the use of only JavaScript to build an application. Some other companies that use Node.JS are Walmart, Trello, Medium and Groupon.
